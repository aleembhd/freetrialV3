----------telecaller and manager login prompts ----------
Listen to me very carefully focus more on this update with marketing manager buttons clicked the login details With is appearing I need the same login details Pop up when I click telecaller button as well . when telecaller enters email: telecaller1@gmail.com password : telecaller@123 the dial pad should open And every call made on the dialpad .html(script code is in the same file) should store on firebase realtimedatabase with email: telecaller1@gmail.com and when marketing manager enters email: admin1@gmail.com & password: admin@123 it should fetch only calls made by telecaller with email: telecaller1@gmail.com from firebase realtime database on maindashboard.html (script code is linked to script.js). Now case 2 : when telecaller enters email: telecaller2@gmail.com password : telecaller@123 the dial pad should open And every call made on the dialpad .html(script code is in the same file) should store on firebase realtimedatabase with email: telecaller2@gmail.com and when marketing manager enters email: admin2@gmail.com & password: admin@123 it should fetch only calls made by telecaller with email: telecaller2@gmail.com from firebase realtime database on maindashboard.html (script code is linked to script.js).

-------firebase login----------
On index.html Instead of storing the Email ID and password locality I have an idea ----2nd---I have created firebase authentication email password in that I have added the email ids and passwords for telecaller the login credientials are telecaller1@gmail.com and password is telecaller@123 and telecaller2@gmail.com and password is telecaller@123 and for marketing manager admin1@gmail.com and password is admin@123 and admin2@gmail.com and password is admin@123 . Keep everything as it is just whenever the password username and passwords are being entered cheque whether the user name and password are from Firebase credentials I mean firebase authentication or not if they are from firebase authentication allow the user then otherwise dont allow




----3rd----similarly when I enter admin1@gmail.com and password admin@123 It should only fetch telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller1@gmail.com" this calls only and successfully display on  today calls on  today_calls.html when calender date is selected case2: when I enter admin2@gmail.com and password admin@123 It should only fetch telecallerEmail
:
"telecaller2@gmail.com" this calls only and successfully display today calls on  today_calls.htmlwhen date in the calender is selected and clicked on submit




1st-----------------imp--------------
listen to me very carefully i will be adding more telecallers and marketing manager email ids like telecaller3@gmail.com telecaller4@gmail.com etc... with password : telecaller@123 and more marketing manager email ids like admin3@gmail.com admin4@gmail.com etc... with password : admin@123 etc.... i will be initializing the email and passwords on fire base authentication and the pattern is telecaller3@gmail.com data will be only accessed by the marketing manager email ids like admin3@gmail.com similarly telecaller4@gmail.com data will be only accessed by the marketing manager email ids like admin4@gmail.com where should i make code changes in index.html, UI of maindashboard.html(script is linked to script.js) , script.js, monthly_calls.html, today_calls.html . tell me in detail where exactly do i need to add things on each file so that when ever i want i can add the telecaller email ids and marketing manager email ids in the code of each file mentioned above . NOTE : i will be creating the telecaller email ids and passwords and marketing manager email ids and passwords on firebase authentication 
The pattern telecallerX@gmail.com will be associated with adminX@gmail.com, where X is any number.
